# Lab4_IntroToUnity

## Team Members:
* Kelsey Anderson
* Jesica Maria Ramirez Toscano

## Goals:

The primary learning goals of this lab are:
* Become familiar with Unity
* Create Objects, Prefabs, and Materials
* Create C# scripts for Movement
* Automatic and with User input
* Using either native variables or RigidBody
* Create C# Collisions and use Unity Collider Components

## Implementation Notes:
* The Particle System was used to create two types of particles (extra credit):
  1. Small sparkles to highlight goal objects.
  2. Larger bursts when a goal is collected.
* Simple animation added to the N_ShapedObstacle: moves from one side to another.
* The halo effect was also applied to our goal materials.
* In order to make the camera behave properly, we fixed rotation on the Marble object's RigidBody.
