# Lab4_IntroToUnity

## Team Members:
* Kelsey Anderson (testing git clone)
* Jesica Maria Ramirez Toscano

Goals:

The primary learning goals of this lab are:
* Become familiar with Unity
* Create Objects, Prefabs, and Materials
* Create C# scripts for Movement
* Automatic and with User input
* Using either native variables or RigidBody
* Create C# Collisions and use Unity Collider Components

The topics covered in this homework will roughly cover chapters 6 and 7 in the textbook. 
We will focus on some pieces more than others (although some things not covered in this lab from those chapters can be done for extra credit). 
Definitely give these chapters a read beforehand, and keep them handy as you do this lab. 
This is where the book truly shines - it gives very clear explanations and provides code for how to do the most common, useful game actions.
